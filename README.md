# A tool for recognizing and editing character bounding boxes and class annotations

**!!! Project in Progress !!!**

Goal:

*scissors* is a tool to visualize, edit, and recognize bounding boxes
and character class annotations of printed and hand-written characters
in scanned texts.

Character bounding boxes together with the corresponding character
class annotations are an essential part of the data necessary to train
machine learning algorithms in optical character recognition (OCR)
tasks.
